# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending me an email at security@ashgw.me. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

I will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version is supported, and I will provide security patches for vulnerabilities discovered in this version. So I always recommend using the [latest release](https://github.com/AshGw/ts-roids/releases/latest).
